# MeanStars

This code provides functionality for automating calculations based on Erik Mamajek's "A Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence" (http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt).

The purpose of the code is to allow users to automatically interpolate the property columns of the table, and to calcualte colors based on any combination of the photometry columns.
